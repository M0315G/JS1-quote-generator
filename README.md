# JS1-quote-generator

This is one of the inital projects created at the time I was learning Java Script. Feel free to play with it. 

You can find the project live here.

Every time you click on 'New Quote' button, it'll fetch a quote randomly and display it to you.

You can also, tweet the quote using the 'Tweet This!' button.
